# Shouty - Python

This is a port of Shouty to Python and Behave.

[The original Shouty](https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.java) is a [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io) open source training exercise that I first learned from [Seb Rose](https://leanpub.com/u/sebrose). Thanks, Seb!

Here's the original README, modified for Python:

# Shouty

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 1000m can hear it.

Shouty doesn't exist yet &mdash; you will implement it yourself!

That is, if you're attending a BDD/Cucumber course.

## You will need

1. A Python IDE (e.g. PyCharm)
2. Python 3
3. Behave support for your IDE (It's built-in to PyCharm)

## Get the code

Git:

    git clone https://github.com/rkasper/shouty-python.git

Or simply [download](https://github.com/rkasper/shouty-python/archive/refs/heads/step-1-start-here.zip) a zip and expand it into a directory on your computer.

## Import the project

In PyCharm

`File > Open`

Then browse to the directory where you downloaded `shouty-python` and open the directory. The project should now load.

## Run the tests

On Mac or Linux:
- In PyCharm:
  - Right-click the file `test-all.sh` > Run 'test-all.sh'
- Or in a terminal:
  - Type: `./test-all.sh`

On Windows:
- In PyCharm:
  - Right-click the file `test-all.bat` > Run 'test-all.bat'
- Or in a terminal:
  - Type: `cmd.exe /c test-all.bat`

You should expect to see a couple of tests failing. If so, you're ready to roll!
